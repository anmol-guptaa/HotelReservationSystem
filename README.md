# Hotel Management System

## Description

The Hotel Management System is a powerful application designed to streamline hotel operations, providing an efficient way to manage employees, rooms, customers, and other essential services. The system is divided into two main sections: the Admin Panel (for managers or administrators) and the Reception Panel (for receptionists).

Features

## Admin Panel

The Admin Panel is restricted to authorized personnel only (e.g., Managers or Admins). This ensures that only trusted individuals can perform high-level operations, such as managing employees, adding rooms, and updating driver details.

## Key Features:

1. Add Employee

Register new employees and store their details, such as name, job title, and contact information.



2. Add Room

Add or update information about hotel rooms, including their price, bed type, and availability.



3. Add Driver
Manage driver details, such as their name, company, availability, and assigned vehicles.


## Reception Panel

The Reception Panel is accessible to receptionists to handle day-to-day operations related to customers and room management. Unlike the Admin Panel, the Reception Panel does not require a password, making it easier for receptionists to access and use. However, it is limited to specific functionalities to ensure sensitive data remains secure.
